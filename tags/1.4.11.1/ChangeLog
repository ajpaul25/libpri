	* libpri 1.4.11 released.

2010-05-19 21:50 +0000 [r1703]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: T309 should not do anything with the global call
	  reference call record.

2010-05-19 21:30 +0000 [r1702]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* q921.c: It's amazing what a tiny bug in the Q.921 SDL diagram can
	  do to cause trouble.... Fix issue where V_R was not reset and N_R
	  was consequentially transmitted incorrectly. Particularly in
	  layer 2 initiated re-establishments.

2010-05-11 22:14 +0000 [r1688]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, q931.c, libpri.h: Dialing an invalid
	  extension causes incomplete hangup sequence. Revision -r1489
	  corrected a deviation from Q.931 Section 5.3.2. However, this
	  resulted in an unexpected behaviour change to the upper layer
	  (Asterisk). This change restores the legacy hangup behaviour if
	  the new API call is not used. Use pri_hangup_fix_enable() to
	  follow Q.931 Section 5.3.2 call hangup better. (closes issue
	  #17104) Reported by: shawkris Tested by: rmudgett

2010-04-26 19:54 +0000 [r1664-1675]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: Simplified some protocol discriminator handling code.

	* q931.c: Garbage on the end of Q.931 messages causing calls to
	  fail to connect. The DAHDI driver had a bug where an extra byte
	  appeared on the end of Q.931 messages. This garbage byte caused
	  the message to be discarded with the diagnostic "XXX Message
	  longer than it should be?? XXX". The Q.931 message will no longer
	  be discarded if there were earlier ie's in the message. This
	  patch also addresses the potential problem of reading beyond the
	  buffer when trying to parse the garbage data. Thanks to roeften
	  for the base patch. (closes issue #14378) Reported by: timking

	* q921.c: Avoid using a cast.

	* q931.c: Cleanup some pri debug output line presentation.

2010-04-19 22:40 +0000 [r1625-1630]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri_internal.h, pri_q931.h, q931.c, pridump.c: PTMP NT mode call
	  reference value ambiguity. Since the TE side can pick CR values
	  independently, the TE CR needs to be qualified by TEI to
	  distinguish CR values from other devices. Without doing this,
	  multiple phones on the BRI line will have intermittent call
	  failures. JIRA LIBPRI-30 Also eliminated some wierdness in
	  q931_status() and several places where it is called.

	* q921.c: Fix potential crash when pridump.c calls q921_dump() with
	  NULL pri ptr.

2010-04-15 18:43 +0000 [r1596]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h: Make some internal routines available to
	  other libpri components.

2010-04-09 21:43 +0000 [r1577]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: Only one PROCEEDING message per call please.

2010-03-18 15:50 +0000 [r1534-1547]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: Move a comment closer to where it has relevance.

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, q921.c, q931.c, pri_facility.c:
	  Miscellaneous simple reorganization. 1) Make PRI_MASTER() no
	  longer check for a NULL parameter. It is the caller's
	  responsibility. Not many callers could have passed a NULL without
	  crashing before or after anyway. 2) Replace calls to
	  q931_is_ptmp() with PTMP_MODE(). They were equivalent. 3) Made
	  the following boolean config options bit fields: sendfacility,
	  overlapdial, chan_mapping_logical, and service_message_support.

2010-03-02 23:47 +0000 [r1511]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, q921.c: Restore ability to change the
	  Q.921 K value. The Q.921 rewrite only used value of PRI_TIMER_K
	  right after it was set to the default. The Q.921 window size was
	  thus no longer alterable by the user. (closes issue #16909)

	* q931.c: Must send DISCONNECT if we have sent a response to a
	  SETUP message. Q.931 Section 5.3.2 a) says we send a
	  RELEASE_COMPLETE to reject a call SETUP if we have not already
	  sent a message in response to the SETUP message.

	* pri.c, libpri.h: Minor comment changes.

2010-02-11 17:35 +0000 [r1482]  Wendell Thompson <wthompson@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Added CPUARCH option for selecting a 32-bit build from

2010-02-08 23:29 +0000 [r1470-1476]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* q921.c: Revert useless check of pri->t200_timer value, since
	  scheduler routines check the value anyways.

	* q921.c: Make sure we set the l3initiated flag when PTP links are
	  attempted to be re-established

2010-02-05 23:34 +0000 [r1464]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri.c: pri_restart() is no longer needed since the Q.921 rewrite.
	  Don't output error message for a deprecated function.

2010-01-29 21:55 +0000 [r1457]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* q921.c: Sense of statement was inverted from what it should have
	  been. Might have caused false T200 operation on reception of
	  I-frames.

2010-01-29 19:32 +0000 [r1451]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

2010-01-19 21:53 +0000 [r1426]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q921.c, q931.c: Fix TE PTMP side sending FACILITY messages on the
	  dummy call reference. Only the NT PTMP side can send Q.931
	  broadcast messages. Also removed an inaccurate comment in Q.921
	  and made q921_mdl_handle_error_callback() call the correct struct
	  pri free function.

2010-01-15 18:28 +0000 [r1414]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q921.c, q931.c: Make some debugging messages conditional and some
	  minor reformating changes.

2010-01-13 19:37 +0000 [r1406]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, pri_q921.h, Makefile, pri_q931.h, q921.c,
	  q931.c: Merge of Q.921 rewrite branch for wider testing.

2009-12-09 20:59 +0000 [r1374]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: Extracted q931_fill_ring_event() from
	  post_handle_q931_message(). Done so it is easier to see what was
	  done in ccbs branch.

2009-11-21 02:40 +0000 [r1345-1351]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h: Fix debug output so built up output lines
	  are readable again. A recent change to Asterisk put the span
	  number at the begining of each line. This is a good thing if you
	  need to debug multiple spans or forget which span you are
	  debugging. Unfortunately, any pri_message() output that is not a
	  complete line is messed up. The pri_message() function now will
	  accumulate line output until a '\n' is seen on the end.

	* pri_internal.h, q931.c, pri_facility.c: Delay processing of
	  facility ie's after all other ie's are processed. * Some ROSE
	  message processing depends on the presence of other ies. The
	  DivertingLegInformation1, and 3 messages will be used as the
	  default connected line number if the connected number ie is not
	  present. The redirecting number ie is used as a default to the
	  redirecting number in the DivertingLegInformation2 message if the
	  ROSE message does not contain it and the redirecting number ie is
	  present. * Some ROSE message processing depends upon other ie
	  values. The StatusRequest, CCBS-T-Call, and CcRingout messages
	  collectively need the BC, HLC, LLC, called number, called
	  subaddress, calling number, and calling subaddress ie information
	  to be available.

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, q931.c, pri_facility.c, pri_facility.h,
	  libpri.h: Reimplement callback mechanism to handle APDU response
	  messages that we care about. 1) No sent messages will remain in
	  the APDU queue unless they have an active timer to remove them.
	  The dummy call reference call and global call reference call
	  structures will not act like a memory leak to sent messages. 2)
	  The new T-RESPONSE timer will be the generic response guard if
	  the standards do not otherwise specify a timer for a message
	  response. 3) The callback will be called. If it is called because
	  of a response message, then the callback has an opportunity to
	  indicate if more responses are expected.

	* libpri.h: We now have 32 timers. No need to reserve minimum space
	  anymore.

	* pri_internal.h, pri_facility.c: There must be only one source for
	  the invoke id values per D channel group. If there are
	  potentially multiple sources for the invoke id sequence then we
	  could get confused if there are multiple outstanding messages
	  with the same invoke id that get responses.

2009-11-11 00:22 +0000 [r1291]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* pri_internal.h, q921.c: Make sure we also revive links for PRIs,
	  not just PTMP TE BRIs when we get a disconnect message

2009-11-10 21:51 +0000 [r1283]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri_internal.h, q931.c, pri_facility.c, pri_facility.h: The
	  facility ie queue needs to remove facilities that have been sent.
	  The facility ie queue needs to remove facilities that have been
	  sent. Otherwise, the queue just grows until the call is
	  terminated. AOC messages can clog the queue during a long call
	  and the dummy call reference may never be deleted. Also removed
	  unneeded elements of struct apdu_event. The callback function was
	  not a good idea since many facility messages do not have
	  responses and the callback would prevents removal of events from
	  the list.

2009-11-10 20:25 +0000 [r1276]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, q931.c, libpri.h: Add dummy call reference
	  support. Fixes problem where PTMP NT mode responds erroneously to
	  a FACILITY message from a phone on the dummy call reference.
	  LibPRI behaved as if the dummy call reference were an invalid
	  call reference and proceeded to respond on the global call
	  reference.

	* pri_internal.h: Remove unused callingsubaddr[].

	  HOLD/RETRIEVE, Call rerouting/deflection, and keypad facility
	  support. * Added support for BRI PTMP NT mode. (Overlap dialing
	  NT -> TE not supported.) * Added handling of received
	  HOLD/RETRIEVE messages and the optional ability to transfer a
	  held call on disconnect similar to an analog phone. * Added
	  CallRerouting/CallDeflection support for Q.SIG, ETSI PTP, ETSI
	  PTMP. Will reroute/deflect an outgoing call when receive the
	  message. Can use the DAHDISendCallreroutingFacility to send the
	  message for the supported switches. * Added ability to
	  send/receive keypad digits in the SETUP message. Send keypad
	  digits in SETUP message:
	  Dial(DAHDI/g1[/K<keypad_digits>][/extension]) Access any received
	  keypad digits in SETUP message by: ${CHANNEL(keypad_digits)}

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, pri_q931.h, q931.c, libpri.h: Add support
	  for calling and called subaddress. Partial support for COLP
	  subaddress. The Telecom Specs in NZ suggests that SUB ADDRESS is

	* pri_q931.h, q931.c: Add SERVICE message support for the
	  'national' switchtype This set of changes integrates SERVICE
	  message support for the 'national' switchtype. The 'national'
	  switchtype uses the 0x43 protocol discriminator. The 'national'
	  SERVICE/SERVICE ACKNOWLEDGE and AT&T SERVICE/SERVICE ACKNOWLEDGE
	  message values are opposite of each other. This is handled by
	  first determining which protocol discriminator is in use, then
	  responding with the appropriate SERVICE ACKNOWLEDGE value. AT&T
	  SERVICE messages use the 0x3 protocol discriminator. (closes

	* pri_internal.h, pri_q931.h, q931.c: Converted Q931_CALL_STATE_xxx

	* q921.c, q931.c: Optimized calls to pri_schedule_del(). There is
	  no need to test if a scheduled event is running before calling
	  pri_schedule_del().

	* prisched.c: Cleaned up scheduled events handling code. * Fixed
	  pri_schedule_event() to return 0 on error instead of -1. Zero is
	  a safer value to return. Users would not think that a timer was
	  scheduled. * Fixed potential for pri_schedule_del() to write out
	  of bounds of pri_sched[]. The out of bounds access could occur
	  when pri_schedule_event() returned -1. * Made use all pri_sched[]
	  entries. pri_sched[0] was previously unused. * Removed some
	  unneeded code and recursion since scheduling only runs on master
	  D channel structures. * Added doxygen comments. * Renamed struct
	  pri *pri variables to struct pri *ctrl in this file.

	* pri.c, pri_internal.h, q931.c, libpri.h: Add support for sending
	  Reverse Charging Indication IE on ISDN PRI. Add the ability to
	  transmit a Reverse Charging Indication IE during a SETUP message.
	  In passing, re-work some of the receive logic to be forwards
	  compatible with new RCI values that may be added in the future.
	  Also removed the PRI_REVERSECHARGE_SUPPORT define that I added on
	  the last commit since we can just check for
	  PRI_REVERSECHARGE_NONE or _REQUESTED on the Asterisk side to
	  determine support for this. Special thanks to rmudgett who could
	  have written this in half the time he spent reviewing it, but
	  instead talked me through it. Much appreciated! (issue #13760)

	* pri_facility.c: Miscellaneous minor changes.

2009-06-09 19:47 +0000 [r859]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* q921.c: There are two changes in this commit that are bug fixes
	  for various Q.921 issues found in internal testing. Both were
	  exposed/introduced by the TBR4 compliance patch for bug #12861,
	  in changing how retransmissions and in how the transmission queue
	  was maintained. TX-RX message flow and acknowledgement was
	  severely restricted, since the patch changed the behavior so that
	  pending untransmitted frames would not actually be send until the
	  next RR was received in normal circumstances, or REJ when a
	  reject frame was received. On busy links, this can severly limit
	  the amount of useful traffic that is sent, and can slow down
	  message transmission. Until someone can point out where in Q.921
	  it is mandated for us to wait for RR frames to start sending
	  untransmitted messages, the first change is to allow us to send
	  untransmitted frames when we receive new I frames as well, with
	  updated N(R). The other bug fixed is a situation caused by the
	  restricted traffic flow, if an outside process tries to send an
	  I-frame asynchronous to an RR frame, when the transmit window was
	  previously closed and then opened up but an RR has not been
	  received yet. A bug was found with the integration of the old
	  transmit code with the new reject handling code which caused the
	  new frame to be sent immediately, regardless if there were any
	  pending untransmitted I-frames in the queue to be sent and
	  causing an out of order I-frame to be sent to the other side.
	  This bug is also fixed in this patch.

2009-06-03 22:51 +0000 [r836-848]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* asn1_primitive.c: Made ASN.1 memory dump also display printable
	  characters.

	* q931.c: Renamed callstate2str() to q931_call_state_str().

	* q931.c: Made transmit_facility() debug message indiate to which
	  message the facility ie is being added.

2009-05-29 15:39 +0000 [r824]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: Renamed local struct pri *pri variables to struct pri
	  *ctrl in q931.c. The context tagging for my editor is much
	  happier now that the struct and the variable do not have the same
	  name. (At least for this file.)

2009-05-20 15:03 +0000 [r804]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* q931.c: Removed usage of FUNC_DUMP(), FUNC_RECV(), and
	  FUNC_SEND() defines. They did not really help and hindered easy
	  lookup of parameter types.

2009-05-13 15:17 +0000 [r798]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* pri.c, pri_q931.h, q931.c, libpri.h: Add 'const' qualifier to
	  character string argument to keypad facility API calls These API
	  calls do not modify the string supplied, and should not be
	  allowed to modify it, so this patch adds a 'const' qualifier to
	  that argument to allow the compiler to enforce this restriction
	  (and allow callers of the API that already have a 'const' pointer
	  to be able to pass it to this API).

2009-05-07 16:21 +0000 [r790-794]  Richard Mudgett <rmudgett@digium.com>

	* pri_internal.h, pri_q931.h, q931.c: Minor code clean up.

	* q931.c: Avoid a stale pointer crash if the TE BRI TEI is removed
	  when active calls exist. Made the q931_call record point to the
	  master D channel control structure instead of the BRI TEI
	  subchannel control structure. When a layer 3 message is sent, the
	  current TEI subchannel control structure is used.
